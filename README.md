## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Module not found" error**
```bash
pip install flask
```

**2. Port already in use**
The app runs on port 5000 by default. If it's busy, the app will show an error. Stop other applications using port 5000 or modify the port in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Change to 5001
```

**3. Database issues**
If you encounter database errors, delete `quizmaster.db` and restart the app. It will recreate the database with sample data.

**4. Permission errors**
Make sure you have write permissions in the project directory for the SQLite database.

## 🎮 Demo Account
The application will automatically create sample data including:
- 8 quiz categories
- Multiple quizzes per category
- Sample questions and answers
- Achievement system

## 🛠️ Development Mode
The app runs in debug mode by default, which means:
- Automatic reloading when you make changes
- Detailed error messages
- Debug toolbar available

## 📱 Mobile Access
The application is mobile-responsive. You can access it from your phone by:
1. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same network
2. Find your computer's IP address
3. Access `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5000` from your phone

## 🔒 Security Note
This is a development setup. For production use, you should:
- Change the secret key in `app.py`
- Use proper password hashing
- Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn
- Set up proper database security

## 📞 Need Help?
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that Python and Flask are properly installed
2. Ensure you're in the correct directory
3. Check the console output for error messages
4. Make sure port 5000 is available
